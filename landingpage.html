            <h1>Mama Earth</h1>
            <p> Mamaearth is an Indian skincare and wellness brand that gained 
                popularity for its range of natural and toxin-free products. 
                Founded in 2016 by Varun Alagh and Ghazal Alagh, the company initially
                 started with products targeted towards babies and mothers, hence the name "Mamaearth". 
                However, it has since expanded its product line to include skincare, haircare, 
                and wellness products for people of all ages.

                Mamaearth gained attention for its emphasis on natural and chemical-free ingredients, 
                catering to the growing demand for safer and more sustainable personal care products.
                They use ingredients like aloe vera, coconut oil, neem, turmeric, and 
                other herbal extracts known for their beneficial properties.
                Mamaearth's products are available both online through its website and various e-commerce platforms
                as well as offline through retail partnerships. The company has garnered a loyal customer base, particularly 
                among those seeking natural alternatives in personal care.
